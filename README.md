# Szekesfehervar-Tourguide

The ERASMUS program was a great opportunity to develop new skills, meet new people, getting real world work experience and leveling up my portfolio. It also made me more responsible and more open-minded.
The Vocational School we visited was also a great experience. All the children and teachers were very friendly and hospitable. We met with the student and got to know each other. The teacher told us to collaborate with the students and create a simple tour guide about a city in Hungary. We split up to teams and I teamed up with Alex. I found easier communicating with Alex than the other students and we managed to make the website.
We used HTML, CSS, Javascript and the Bootstrap Framework to create the website. We also used the Google maps API to render a map of that city in the website.
Alex was responsible for the website’s design and tour guide’s information and I was for the coding and technical part of the project
